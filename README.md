**Assetify.library** is an open-source custom asset loading library developed by **vStudio** for [Multi Theft Auto \(MTA\)](https://multitheftauto.com/). This innovative library integrates advanced asset loading and unloading techniques, tailored specifically for gamemode development, enabling efficient and rapid asset manipulation. With a strong emphasis on performance, Assetify.library empowers developers to fully customize their environments without the concern of performance issues.

**Frustrated with replacing objects?** Assetify.library streamlines the process by utilizing an asset-pack method, allowing you to load your assets seamlessly without altering the default ones. 

**Looking to create a fully custom map?** This library is specifically designed for that purpose! It offers extensive support for a wide range of asset categories, including `module`, `animation`, `sound`, `scene`, `character`, `vehicle`, `weapon`, `object`, and `inventory` asset-packs, as well as custom graphics!
