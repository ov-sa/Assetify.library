**Assetify.library** is an open-source custom asset loading library developed by **vStudio** for [Multi Theft Auto \(MTA\)](https://multitheftauto.com/). This innovative library integrates advanced asset loading and unloading techniques, tailored specifically for gamemode development, enabling efficient and rapid asset manipulation. With a strong emphasis on performance, Assetify.library empowers developers to fully customize their environments without the concern of performance issues.

**Frustrated with replacing objects?** Assetify.library streamlines the process by utilizing an asset-pack method, allowing you to load your assets seamlessly without altering the default ones. 

**Creating a fully custom map?** This library is designed precisely for that purpose! It provides unlimited support for various asset categories, including `Module`, `Animation`, `Sound`, `Scene`, `Character`, `Vehicle`, `Weapon`, `Object`, and `Inventory` Asset-Packs, in addition to custom graphics.
